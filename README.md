# 7-Segment Clock Reborn
My first attempt at a full implementation of a 7-segment style clock built with individually addressable LEDs and 3D printed housings left more to be desired in terms of the final product. Here is my 2nd attempt at creating my dream wall clock from scratch. If you would like to also build this clock youre free to use the code and files I have created for your own personal use. Just note that my code was built using PlatformIO on VSCode so utilize any other IDE's at your own risk. 

## Design Process
### 1. Rough circuit prototypes
- Utilized PlatformIO and VSCode to program Arduino Uno and DS1307 RTC to drive a single 7-seg display as proof of concept.

- Updated code to now work on 4 digit 7-segment display as the final product will be similar to that, just larger and illuminated with LEDs.

### 2. 3D modeling and printing
- Created the model and printed a 40% scale model of it to ensure it fit together.

- Updated the model and printed revision two at 40% scale once again.

### 3. Final Construction
