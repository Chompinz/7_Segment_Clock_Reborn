# 7-Segment Clock Reborn
My first attempt at a full implementation of a 7-segment style clock built with individually addressable LEDs and 3D printed housings left more to be desired in terms of the final product. Here is my 2nd attempt at creating my dream wall clock from scratch. 

## Design Process
1. Rough circuit prototypes
   - Utilized PlatformIO and VSCode to program Arduino Uno and DS1307 RTC to drive a single 7-seg display as proof of concept.

   - Updated code to now work on 4 7-segment display as the final product will be similar to that, just larger.

2. 3D modeling and printing
3. Final Construction
